// Configurations problem.
// SPM allow only two configurations: debug and release.
// If build name contains Debug - this is debug build.
// Other flags from Xcode configuration don't pass to SPM.
// This means `#if DEBUG` will work only in SPM debug build.

// Dsym problem.
// Xcode generated Dsym for local packages only in Release configuration. DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT isn't used.ðŸ˜¬
// External dependencies don't have this problem. There are contains in App.dsym file.
// We should to use configuration with "Release" name for generate Dsyms in nightly buils for local packages.

// We can't use `#if DEBUG` and generate Dsyms at the same time for local packages ðŸ˜­.
// One of solution - crate 'Release' build and pass debug flags to package.
// Other solution. Allow for debug configuration dsyms in each local package. But this desition will slow down local builds.

// Check it in feature XCode versions. Maybe it will be fixed.

// Temporary solution - setup environment from main target.
// In the main target, always use #if. This way, the compiler will cut out unused code.
