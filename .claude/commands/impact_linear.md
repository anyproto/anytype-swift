# Linear Context Gathering for iOS Release (View-Based Approach)

## Purpose
This document guides the process of gathering comprehensive context from Linear for iOS release impact analysis and changelog generation, using a pre-configured Linear view to simplify project discovery.

## Process

### Step 1: Get Release Information
Ask the user:
- "What is the release task id"
- "What is the Linear view URL/name for the release projects?"
- Example responses: 
  - Release ID: "IOS-4626"
  - View: "Release 12 iOS Projects" or direct view URL

### Step 2: Get Projects from Linear View (SYSTEMATIC APPROACH)
1. **Look at the Linear view screenshot/URL provided**
2. **List every single project name visible in the view systematically**
3. **Use `mcp__linear__get_project` for each project name to get full details**
4. **Capture project descriptions, status, priority, and completion % for each**
5. **Capture the Linear URL for each project/epic in the view**
6. **Count total projects to validate completeness** - ensure no projects are missed

### Step 3: Detailed Information Gathering with Links
For EACH project/epic from the view:

#### A. Basic Information with URLs
- Issue ID and Title
- **Full Linear URL** (e.g., https://linear.app/company/issue/IOS-1234)
- **Parent Project URL** and name (if applicable)
- Description and acceptance criteria
- Status (To Do, In Progress, Done, etc.)
- Priority (Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
- Assignees and reviewers
- Creation and update dates
- **Labels with their URLs**

#### B. Technical Context with References
- **Linked Pull Requests** (capture full GitHub URLs)
- **Related GitHub issues** (full URLs)
- **Linked Linear issues** (full URLs and relationship type)
- **API documentation links**
- **Design/Figma links**
- **Confluence/Notion documentation links**
- Performance benchmarks or dashboard links
- Security assessment links

#### C. Feature Scope with Relationships
- User-facing changes
- New functionality vs. improvements
- Platform-specific implementations
- Integration points with other features
- **Related epics/stories URLs** (even if not in the view)

#### D. Risk Assessment with References
- Implementation complexity
- Dependencies on other teams/systems (with Linear issue links)
- Migration requirements (with documentation links)
- Backward compatibility concerns
- Testing coverage needs (with test plan links if available)

#### E. Sub-task Analysis with Full Hierarchy
For each project/epic, find and analyze ALL sub-tasks:
- Use parentId search to find direct children
- **Capture full parent-child URL relationships**
- Look for related implementation tasks
- **Create a URL hierarchy map**

### Step 4: Cross-Platform Context with Links
- Find related Desktop/Web releases (with Linear URLs)
- Identify shared middleware dependencies (with issue links)
- Note platform-specific variations
- **Link to cross-platform coordination issues**

### Step 5: Create Comprehensive Context Summary with Full References
**CRITICAL: Always save the analysis as a file immediately after completion**

2. **[Recommendation 2]** - Related: [URL]
3. **[Recommendation 3]** - Related: [URL]
```

## Critical Success Factors
1. **View Validation**: Ensure all projects from the Linear view are captured
2. **URL Capture**: Record full Linear URLs for every issue, project, and relationship
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Document all parent-child and related issue connections
4. **External Links**: Capture all GitHub, documentation, and design URLs
5. **Sub-task Discovery**: For each project, find all child tasks
6. **Technical Deep Dive**: Don't just list features, understand implementation impact
7. **Risk-First Analysis**: Lead with what could go wrong, not just what's planned

## Usage Instructions
1. Start by asking for:
   - The release ID
   - The Linear view URL or name containing all release projects
2. **SYSTEMATIC PROJECT EXTRACTION:**
   - Look at the Linear view screenshot/URL provided
   - List every single project name visible in the view
   - Use `mcp__linear__get_project` for each project name
   - Get full project descriptions, status, priority, completion %
3. For each project in the view:
   - Gather comprehensive details from project description
   - Find all sub-tasks using parentId search
   - Capture all URLs and relationships
   - Document technical dependencies
4. Create hierarchy maps showing relationships
5. Include all external references (GitHub, Figma, docs)
6. **MANDATORY:** Save as: `linear_context_release_[NUMBER].md` - do not skip this step
