# iOS Release Impact Analysis & Comprehensive Changelog Generator

## Purpose
This document combines Linear context and Git changes to produce comprehensive impact analysis and detailed changelog for professional writers.

## Required Inputs
1. `linear_context_release_[NUMBER].md` - From Part 1
2. `git_changes_release_[NUMBER].md` - From Part 2
3. Release number

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Cross-Reference Linear and Git Data
For each Linear project/feature:
1. Find corresponding code changes in Git data
2. Match commit messages to Linear story IDs
3. Identify gaps (Linear stories without code changes, or vice versa)
4. Note any discrepancies

### Step 2: Calculate Impact Scores
For each change:
- **High Impact**: Core functionality, authentication, data model, critical UI
- **Medium Impact**: Feature additions, non-critical UI, configuration
- **Low Impact**: Minor fixes, documentation, tests

Consider:
- Number of files changed
- Type of files (core vs peripheral)
- Linear priority
- Risk areas identified

### Step 3: Generate Testing Recommendations
Based on:
- Linear acceptance criteria
- Code change scope
- Risk assessment
- Dependencies
